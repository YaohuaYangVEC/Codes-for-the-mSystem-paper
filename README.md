# R scripts for the mSystem paper (mSystems00201-19) by Yaohua Yang et al.

This folder contains the R scripts used for generating the results presented in a paper submitted to mSystems (Yang Y, et al. mSystems00201-19) to facilitate  reviewers' review.

Notices for reviewers:

We didn't upload the input files needed for each script because as described in our manuscript, the 16S rRNA sequencing data and phenotype data of the SCCS participants can only be obtained through the SCCS online request system (https://www.southerncommunitystudy.org/research-opportunities.html).
